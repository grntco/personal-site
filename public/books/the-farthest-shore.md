_The Farthest Shore_ by Ursula K. Le Guin is technically the end of the _Earthsea_ "trilogy," although she went on to write three more books in the series almost 20 years later. I read the first two books last year, really enjoying the first (_A Wizard of Earthsea_) and somewhat enjoying the second (_The Tombs of Atuan_).

_The Farthest Shore_ returns to the hero of the first book, Ged, who is now an older wizard and the Archmage of Roke (basically the master wizard of all wizards). Instead of focusing on Ged, though, this book's protagonist is a young prince named Arren. Together, Ged and Arren travel across Earthsea to discover why many wizards' magic is disappearing. The novel felt very much like a classic high-fantasy story where a young hero and a wizard mentor go on a quest to save the world, stopping by new places and meeting new people and overcoming challenges.

The world of Earthsea is a lot of what makes these books so interesting. In Earthsea, islands with different cultures are isolated by vast spreads of sea. Wizards invoke magic by speaking in an ancient language and calling the true names of things. Dragons are ancient creatures and highly intelligent, more so than humans. They are also terrifying, and pretty similar to Smaug in many ways.

For sure the best part of the book is the relationship between Ged and Arren. It reminded me of the relationships between other wizards and heroes: Gandalf and Bilbo, Dumbledore and Harry, Merlin and Arthur.

Ged is at times quirky and other times powerful and frightening. But he is always wise. And Arren is just a good person wanting to do what's right. He holds Ged with the highest regard and strives to protect him at all costs. There are a few moments reminiscent of Dumbledore and Harry's relationship in the _The Half-Blood Prince_, in particular. Throughout his travels, Arren grows up a lot and in the end learns what it takes to be a king.

Overall, I really enjoyed the simplicity of this book. It had just one story to tell and told it well, and didn’t drag on for pages on end with world-building and subplots. Apparently this is the book that most of the Studio Ghibli movie _Tales from Earthsea_ is based on, so I'll have to watch that.
