Living in and working remotely from Greenville, South Carolina

## Personal

-   Reading _The Lord of the Rings_. I've never read the series through fully before, despite watching the movies countless times.
-   Lifting. Started training four days a week (two days on, one to two days rest in-between) over the summer and been enjoying sticking with it. Low rep/sets, high intensity.
-   Watching _The Penguin_. Trying to watch less TV lately, but this show is awesome. Rewatched _The Batman_ too.
-   Also enjoying Carl Sagan's _Cosmos_. "Mind-blowing" doesn't do this show justice. Perhaps my favorite nonfiction TV show.
-   Baking! A new-ish hobby. Recent favorites include Apple Coffee Cake and Tiramisu (not really a bake but still was very good).
-   Taking a break from scrolling X.

## Learning

-   Backend development through The Odin Project's Node.js module. Over halfway through this course and nearly at the end of the entire Full-Stack JavaScript Path. It's been a journey!
-   React, by building this website.

## Work

-   Working remotely as a web developer at Classical Conversations
-   Building with PHP, JavaScript, WordPress, and SQL
-   Developing an application for internal use to create and manage the company's redirect rules across 15+ websites using PHP, JavaScript, WordPress, and a MySQL database
