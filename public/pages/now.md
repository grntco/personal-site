## Personal

-   Reading _Practical Zen_.
-   Lifting and running. Considering training for a half-marathon (we'll see, would probably die).
-   Watching _Initial D_ and _The Great British Baking Show_.
-   Taking a break from scrolling X.
-   Learning backend development through The Odin Project's Node.js module. Over halfway through this course and nearly at the end of the entire Full-Stack JavaScript Path. It's been a journey!
-   Also learning React, in part by building this website.

## Work

-   Working remotely in Greenville, SC as a web developer at Classical Conversations.
-   Creating and maintaining 15+ websites using PHP, JavaScript, WordPress, SQL, and Git.
-   Developing a full-stack application for internal use to create and manage the company's redirect rules across multiple websites and servers. Stack includes PHP, JavaScript, WordPress (for a database, convenient hooks, routing, and authentication), and a MySQL database.
