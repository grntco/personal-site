Hi! I'm Grant Collins, a self-taught developer living in and working remotely from Greenville, South Carolina.

I learned to code using online resources (notably [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)) after graduating with a bachelor's from Anderson University (SC) in 2021.

Currently, I'm continuing on my journey as a web developer at Classical Conversations, a homeschool curriculum provider and support organization. Here, I work mostly with PHP, JavaScript, and WordPress. Outside of work, I am pursuing the [Full-Stack JavaScript Path](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript) from The Odin Project. At the time of writing this, I am halfway through the [Node.js course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/nodejs), the final one in the developer pathway.

Apart from coding, I like other thingsâ€”lifting weights, reading books (mostly sci-fi), spending time with family, and, more recently, running. I write not that often, and even less often publish what I've written on this website.

If you are an employer interested in me for a developer role, I encourage you to have a browse through the [projects](/projects) I've built, my [resume](/resume) (you can also download a pdf here), and any [posts](/blog) about coding.

To contact me, you can send an email to `hello at grant collins dot me` or say hi on X, although I am less likely to respond to the latter.

Still here? See what I'm up to [now](/now), read [about this website](/colophon), browse some of my favorite [things](/things), or visit my [blog](/blog).
