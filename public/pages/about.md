Hi! I'm Grant Collins, a self-taught developer living in and working remotely from Greenville, South Carolina.

I learned to code using online resources (namely [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)) after earning my bachelor's degree in digital media communications from Anderson University (SC) in 2021. My goal is to write software that improves people's day-to-day lives with a team of developers who I can continually learn from and grow alongside.

Right now, I'm continuing on my journey by working remotely and learning as much as I can as a web developer in the IT department at Classical Conversations, a homeschool curriculum provider and support organization. Here, I work mostly with PHP, JavaScript, and WordPress. In my spare time, I am pursuing the [Full-Stack Developer Path](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript) from The Odin Project. I am halfway through the [Node.js course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/nodejs), the final course in the developer pathway.

Apart from coding, I like other thingsâ€”lifting weights, reading books, spending time with family, and, when I can, hiking the North Carolina mountains. I write not that often, and even less often publish what I've written on this website. I recently refreshed this website to encourage myself to write more, especially about learnings from my developer journey and books I'm reading.

If you are a recruiter or employer interested in hiring me for a software developer position, I encourage you to have a browse through the [projects I've built](/projects), my [resume](/resume) (you can also download a pdf here), and any of my [blog posts](/blog) about coding, in particular my self-taught developer journey and my experience with The Odin Project.

To contact me, you can send an email to ```{hello at grant collins dot me}``` or say hi on X, although I will likely be less likely to respond to the latter.

Still here? See what I'm up to [now](/now), read [about this website](/colophon), browse some of [the tools I like](/tools), or visit my [blog](/blog).
