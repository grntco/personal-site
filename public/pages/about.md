Hi! I'm Grant Collins, a self-taught developer working remotely from Greenville, South Carolina.

After graduating college in 2020, I learned to code using online resources (primarily [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)).

Currently, I'm working as a web developer at Classical Conversations, a homeschool curriculum provider and support organization. Here, I use mostly PHP, JavaScript, and WordPress. Outside of work, I am following the [Node.js course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/nodejs) in the [Full-Stack JavaScript Path](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript) from The Odin Project.

Apart from coding, I like other thingsâ€”spending time with my wife and family, [reading](/library), and exercising.

If you're interested in me for a developer role, consider taking a look through my [projects](/projects).

To contact me, you can send an email to [grantcollins03@gmail.com](mailto:grantcollins03@gmail.com).

Still here? See what I'm up to [now](/now) or visit my [blog](/blog).
