This is a project for The Odin Project's JavaScript course to create [a battleship game](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-battleship) to practice unit testing. I used JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Jest.

This is the first major project on which I implemented unit testing. I learned which methods to test, how to use mocking, and how to organize my tests with test suites.

Testing aside, I also practiced much of what I learned throughout the JavaScript course in this final project, including building the project with webpack and JS modules.

### How to Play

1. Setup your board by placing your battleships on it. Drag your ship over the board and click on any cell to place it down. You can choose to keep a ship horizontal or rotate it before you place it, or choose to generate a random ship on the board instead.
2. Once you have placed your six ships on your board, you can begin playing! To make attack the enemy, click any cell on their board. As you attack, the enemy will simultaneously attack your board and attempt to hit your ships. Misses are shown in white and hits are shown in a blinking red.
3. To win the game, sink all the enemy ships before they sink yours! To sink an enemy ship, you must hit all the cells that contain that ship.
