# File Uploader

This is a project created for The Odin Project's Node.js course to build an [Google Drive-esque application](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-file-uploader).

The main purpose of this project was to use Prisma ORM with a PostgreSQL database. I also used Supabase for the first time for file storage, and continued practicing with more familiar tools like Passport.js with bcryptjs for authentication, multer, connect-flash, Express Validator, and EJS.

## Features:

-   Create a File Uploader account.
-   Once logged in to your account, you can upload files and create folders.
-   Edit files to assign them to a folder or change their names.
-   Delete and download files.
-   Delete folders (your files in that folder will still be saved).
-   All your files and folders are inaccessable to other users.
