This is a project for The Odin Project's JavaScript course to create a [to-do list app](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-todo-list).

I used Vanilla JS and HTML/CSS. I learned and implmented tools and concepts such as Webpack, localStorage, JS modules and classes, and the principles of OOP.

### Features

-   View, add, edit, and delete new to-dos and projects.
-   Assign to-dos to projects and give them due dates.
-   Toggle between light/dark themes.
