This is a project for The Odin Project's JavaScript course to create [a to-do list web application](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-todo-list).

I used HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS.

I learned and implmented tools and concepts such as Webpack, localStorage, JS modules and classes, and the principles of OOP.
