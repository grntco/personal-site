This is [a weather app](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-weather-app) for The Odin Project's JavaScript course. I learned to work with APIs, using the free tier of the [Weather API](https://www.weatherapi.com/), and practice Promises with async/await. I also used Webpack.

### Features

-   Search for a city to see its weather data, including hourly and daily (up to three days) of temperatures and conditions.

### Credits

-   [Weather API](https://www.weatherapi.com/)
