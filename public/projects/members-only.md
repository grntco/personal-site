# Members Only

This is a project created for The Odin Project's Node.js course to build an application that [involves user authentication](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-nodejs-members-only).

I learned to handle authentication requests using the Passport.js local strategy, including protecting certain routes and actions if a user does not have certain privileges. User passwords are hashed and validated using bcryptjs. I also continued practicing with Node/Express, Express Validator, EJS, and PostgreSQL.

## Features:

- Create an account for Members Only and log into your account.
- As a general user, you can post new messages view all user messages but are unable to see message times and authors. 
- Join the club to become a member of Members Only and gain access to see message times and authors.
- If you create an account as an admin, you'll gain the ability to delete user messages.
- Log out and try to view certain routes (/, /join), and you will get redirected to the login page.
